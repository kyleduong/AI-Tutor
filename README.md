    *   Stores user data and potentially tutoring history in Firestore.
*   **Clean and Intuitive UI:** Built with Flutter for a cross-platform experience and a user-friendly interface.
*   **Asynchronous Data Loading:**  Ensures a smooth user experience by handling API calls and data retrieval in the background.

## Technologies Used

*   **Flutter:**  A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
*   **Dart:**  The programming language used to build Flutter apps.
*   **Firebase Firestore:** A NoSQL cloud database for storing and syncing data.
*   **Firebase Authentication:**  (Optional) A service for authenticating users.
*   **OpenAI API:**  Leverages the power of OpenAI's language models to generate personalized tutoring content.
*   **`http` package:**  For making HTTP requests to the OpenAI API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Flutter SDK:** [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
*   **Dart SDK:** Included with the Flutter SDK.
*   **Firebase Project:**  [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
*   **OpenAI API Key:**  [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
*   **FlutterFire CLI:**  `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
*   **An IDE (e.g., VS Code with Flutter extension, Android Studio)**

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Firebase Configuration:**

    *   Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
    *   Register your Flutter app with Firebase (following the instructions in the Firebase Console).
    *   Download the `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) files and place them in their respective `android/app/` and `ios/Runner/` directories.
    *   Run `flutterfire configure` in your project directory.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Configure OpenAI API Key:**

    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project (outside the `lib` folder for security).
    *   Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
        ```

    *   (Optional, if using Firebase Authentication and want to restrict access to certain collections)  Add Firebase Web API Key to the `.env` file:

        ```
        FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
        ```

    *   You'll likely need a package like `flutter_dotenv` to access the API key from your Dart code.  Add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

        ```yaml
        dependencies:
          flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0 # Or the latest version
        ```

    *   And then in your `main.dart` or wherever you need to access the key:

        ```dart
        import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';

        void main() async {
          await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env");
          runApp(MyApp());
        }

        // ... later, access the key like this:
        String openaiApiKey = dotenv.env['OPENAI_API_KEY'] ?? 'OPENAI_API_KEY not found';
        ```

5.  **Run the App:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

    Choose your desired platform (Android, iOS, web, etc.) when prompted.
